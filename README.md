👋 Hi, I’m @tau-brendermoss-socscimgmted-library

👀 I’m interested in enhancing access to library and academic data, promoting digital literacy, and supporting research and learning in the fields of social sciences, management, and education. We are also exploring the integration of large language models (LLMs) and bot-building in educational technology (EdTech) to innovate and improve our services.

🌱 I’m currently learning about the latest developments in library science, data management, LLMs, and EdTech to better serve our academic community.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage digital tools, LLMs, and bots to improve information accessibility, academic research, and educational outcomes.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me at smlref@tauex.tau.ac.il.

😄 Pronouns: We are an inclusive team that welcomes all.
